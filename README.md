SatNOGS Arduino
===============

Repository of Arduino code and Arduino PCB for SatNOGS project.
Refer to block diagram in the repository for wiring documentation.

Electronics and code are modified to work with a bare AtMega48 with the Arduino Bootloader. This spares buying the Arduino Micro. The stepper motor drivers are replaced by DRV8825 modules (Drop-in replacement part) from eBay.

This will be used in our costumized version of the SatNOGS PCB for the High Altitude Object Tracker, which will be part of the SatNOGS project as well.

## TODO
- new PCB layout with AtMega48 and without USB
- adapt code to work on AtMega48
- Instructions for Arduino Setup
